### 18 Qualification and disqualification from membership of the Constitutional Convention

This section is more liberal that the comparative legislation for the Houses of Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Senedd or the Scottish Parliament because this body does not oversee a government but has a constitutional remit.

The working principle is - if you can vote in the Constitution Convention election you can be a member - except for individuals who are ex-officio mentioned in this Bill.
