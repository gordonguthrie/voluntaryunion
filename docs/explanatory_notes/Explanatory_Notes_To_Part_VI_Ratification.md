## Explanatory Notes To Part VI - Ratification

### 25 Referendum

The constitution doesnâ€™t come into force until returned to the sovereign peoples that elected the Constitutional Convention for their ratification.

A majority is required in all 4 parts of the Union as per the Australian constitution.
Super-majorites are a part of the UK constitutional make-up already. For instance, they are used to protect the electoral system in Scotland from simple majority change.

If the constitution contains protected subject matter and super-majorities in whole or in part, then the ratification must require the most stringent of those super-majorities in all 4 parts of the Union.
So if the proposed constitution required a simple majority for amendment except for citizenship which required a 2/3 majority and changes to the electoral system which required 3/4 then the ratifying referendum would require a 3/4 majority in all 4 parts of the Union.

##### Based on [Section 128 of Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/63-64/12/enacted) and [Section 31 of Scotland Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/46/section/31)
