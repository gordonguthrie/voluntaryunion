## Explanatory Notes To Schedule E - Electoral Regions

The seats per region come from the old European Elections regions, with each region being given 5 members of the Constitutional Convention where 1 MEP had been allocated.

This seat distribution should either be revised in an actual bill, or have an appropriate order enabling the UK government to revise it added.
