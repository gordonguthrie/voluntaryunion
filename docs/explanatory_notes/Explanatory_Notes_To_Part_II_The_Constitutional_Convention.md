## Explanatory Notes To Part II - The Constitutional Convention

### 6 The Constitutional Convention

This section sets the scene.

### 7 Duration

The Constitutional Convention has a job to do, it is a transitory body and thus is subject to a time limit.

### 8 Renumeration

Members need to be compensated, and it is to be expected that a significant proportion of the elected members will already be members of an elected body.

The renumeration section aims to regulate double jobbing and the collection of additional monies.

### 9 Legal officers

The writing of a new constitution is a profound legal act. This section ensures that appropriate legal advice from across the 4 constituent parts of the Union has prominent voice.
The legal officers are granted right of audience, hearing and access to documents which means that they can:

* attend sittings of the Constitutional Convention and its committees - and compel the timetable to ensure their participation
* present submissions to the Constitutional Convention by right and have them considered
* get access to any working documents that they wish.

### 10 Financing

Grants the Prime Minister the powers to pay for the running of the convention.
